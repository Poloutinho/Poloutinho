## Summary

My name is Pavlo, I am a third-year student at the Kharkiv Aviation Institute. Coding has been my passion since school, so I chose the Faculty of Software Engineering. I remember this feeling when I wrote my first program, my first sorting algorithm, my first web project. It is important for me to work with a friendly team, where each person is valuable for the company.
